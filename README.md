# Gotils

Welcome to Gotils! This is a repository where I am creating clones of the GNU coreutils using the Go programming language!

## ls
Complete:
- Basic outline of program flow

TODO:
- Color directories
- Add more flags
    - Only flag implemented now is `-l`
    - `-a` is particularly important

## grep
Complete:
- Basic regex matching
- Pipe output from another program into grep

TODO:
- Option flags
- Colorized output
